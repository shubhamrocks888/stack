Implementation using list
Pythonâ€™s buil-in data structure list can be used as a stack. Instead of push(), append() is used to add elements to the top of stack while pop() removes the element in LIFO order.
Unfortunately, list has a few shortcomings. The biggest issue is that it can run into speed issue as it grows. The items in list are stored next to each other in memory, if the stack grows bigger than the block of memory that currently hold it, then Python needs to do some memory allocations. This can lead to some append() calls taking much longer than other ones.
